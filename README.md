Actually I don't know how to introduce myself, knowing oneself could always be hard.

Being a student majoring in SE, it would be better for me to describe pros and cons via lists. Yeah, although the following is not pros and cons

# That's Me!
+ I am a committed programmer. I love it!
+ I love distributed systems.
+ I love reliable, available, and scalable softwares.
+ I love elegant designs and implementations.
+ I love building elegant softwares running on clouds natively.
+ I love unix!

# Why I build a blog like this?
I want my blogs to be pure md files without any ugly annotations.

I build this blog using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Fis3](https://github.com/fex-team/fis3)
