# What
Our system comprises of server-end and front-end. Generally, front-end may consist of browsers, pads, phones. They are essential part of our system which deserve our thinking.

In this post, I will focus on h5 front-end since it's what I'm familiar with.

I have no time for the moment, so I just write down some titles which remind me what I'm thinking about.

# Logging and Monitoring
In backend, we need carefully monitoring our services, but it's very likely that we do not pay enough attention to front-end. 

There are two kind of errors we need to log:

+ window.onerror
+ app error

# Fetch API

# Mobile First Applications

# Offline First Applications
