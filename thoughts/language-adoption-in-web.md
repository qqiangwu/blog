The first language I have learned is C++ and I tend to use it every where when I was young. However, when I was exposed to the web development, I was astonished to find that java and php are extensively adopted almost every where. It got me thinking: why don't we just use C++? It's way more fast!

After a few struggle, I have got the answer.

+ performance: web applications are mostly io intensive, which means that most of the time we are just waiting on the io, not the cpu.
+ development efficiency: modern languages offers better development efficiency and better community support. We can use cpp of course, and the performance may be improved, but the slight performance improvement is not worthy our effort.
+ when to adopt: if the application is running in a pc, fewer dependencies are perferred. Grandma does not know how to install jre.
