Search and DP and both somehow clever brute force, when we need to enumerate all possibilites, they come to the scene. 

So how do we differentiate them in concrete problems?

In DP, we merely care about an optimized value and drop other possibilites. While in search, I elaborately enumerate every possibilites and compose result from them.
