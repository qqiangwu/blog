The following are projects I've ever built. Regretfully I haven't built any meaningful projects. Most of them are just toys.

# Craft
+ [Parameter](https://github.com/qqiangwu/parameter): A C++14 based cpp named parameter library which aimed to be as simple as possible
+ [Miao.string](https://github.com/qqiangwu/miao.string): A string matching library writen in D.
+ [Ysan](https://github.com/qqiangwu/ysan): Yet another Sanguo(The Legend of Three Kindoms) game (WIP)
+ [Fis3-hook-npm](https://github.com/qqiangwu/fis3-hook-npm): A fis3 hook for npm package integration.
+ [Fis3-hook-bower](https://github.com/qqiangwu/fis3-hook-bower): A fis3 hook for bower package integration.

# Toys
+ [Foriou](https://github.com/qqiangwu/Foriou): Yeah, this is a native whim in my freshman year. I've spent a lot of time on it. But regretfully, it is not a practical software. Still, that's my gold memory.
